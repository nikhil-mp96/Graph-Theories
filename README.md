# Mainly there are two types of graphs
1. Undirected Graph
	An Undirected graph is a graph in which edges have no orientation. The edge (u,v) is identical to the edge (v, u).
2. Directed Graph
	A directed graph or digraph is a graph in which edges have orientations. For example, the edge (u, v) is the edge from node u to v. 
3. Weighted Graph
	Many graphs can have edges that contain a certain weight to represent an arbitrary value such as cost, distance, quantity, etc.
	Usually such edges are represented as triplets (u, v, w) and specify wether the graph is Undirected or directed graph.
